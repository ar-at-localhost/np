# Xtras

Provide opt-in support for additional tools and features beyond language support.
Import them alongside the base module and any presets.

Xtras focus on tools, workflows, and features rather than language-specific development.

> [!NOTE]
> Presets might be renamed to `langs` in the future to better distinguish them from
> xtras.
